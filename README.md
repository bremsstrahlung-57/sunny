## Installation üì¶

The only way to install `sunny` for now is from the `.whl` file from the latest release.

1.  **Download the `.whl` file** from the [latest release](https://github.com/bremsstrahlung-57/sunny/releases/latest).

2.  **Install the package**. You have two options:

    -   **Using `pipx` (Recommended for CLI tools)**: This installs `sunny` globally in an isolated environment, so it won't conflict with other packages.

        ```bash
        pipx install sunny-1.2.6-py3-none-any.whl
        ```

    -   **Using `pip`**: This installs `sunny` in your current Python environment.

        ```bash
        pip install sunny-1.2.6-py3-none-any.whl
        ```

3.  **Clean up (Optional)**. You can now delete the downloaded file.
    -   On **Linux/macOS**:
        ```bash
        rm sunny-1.2.6-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
    -   On **Windows**:
        ```powershell
        del sunny-1.2.6-py3-none-any.whl
        ```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Before you can fetch weather data, you need to configure `sunny` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

1.  **Get an API Key:**
    Sign up for a free account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid) to get your API key.

2.  **Initialize Sunny:**
    Run the following command to initialize `sunny`. It will prompt you to enter your API key and set a default location.

    ```bash
    sunny --init
    ```

## Quick Start üöÄ

Once configured, you can get the weather instantly.

```bash
# Get the weather for your default location
